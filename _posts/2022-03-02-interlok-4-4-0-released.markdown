The 4.4.0 release is a small release that focused on some dependency upgrades.

Note: Log4j provides support for JSR 223 scripting languages to be used in some of its components. As of Log4j 2.17.2 the languages to be supported must be specified as a comma separated list in the log4j2.Script.enableLanguages system property. Please refer to the [Apache manual](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#Scripts) for the latest advice.

The formal change log can be found [here](https://interlok.adaptris.net/interlok-docs/#/pages/overview/changelog)
